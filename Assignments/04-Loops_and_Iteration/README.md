# ðŸ“‚ Module 04: Loops and Iteration

This module explores looping in Python using `for` and `while` loops. You'll also learn about `range()`, iterable objects like lists and dictionaries, and the `with` construct (context managers) for reading files and other structured repetition.

## ðŸ”— Assignments

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [01-For_Loops.ipynb](01-For_Loops.ipynb) | Use `for` loops to iterate over lists, ranges, and strings. |
| [02-While_Loops.ipynb](02-While_Loops.ipynb) | Use `while` loops for repeating logic with conditions. |
| [03-File_Loops_and_With.ipynb](03-File_Loops_and_With.ipynb) | Read files safely using `with`, and process lines using loops. |

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Use `for` loops with `range()` and iterables
- Control loop repetition using `while` and boolean conditions
- Use `break` and `continue` to manage loop flow
- Read files using `with open(...) as f:` and iterate over lines
